# TestBash Brighton 2024: Code Challenges Workshop

## Challenge 3: Reading code and giving feedback

### Scenario

At Make Believe Labs, we think collaboration is key, and our engineers understand the importance of useful feedback. To support this, the whole team is expected to be able to read code.

Read some code, try and understand what it's doing, and where it could be improved.

## Instructions

### Option 1: Read the basket component code

Read though the the code for the React component [snack-shop-fe/src/Components/Basket.tsx](../../snack-shop-fe/src/Components/Basket.tsx).

The Basket component is responsible for reading the basket state from the Redux store, and displaying every snack in the basket. It is used in [snack-shop-fe/src/views/Basket.tsx](../../snack-shop-fe/src/views/Basket.tsx).

If you like, you can refer to the Redux Toolkit documentation <https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started> or the React Components documentation <https://react.dev/reference/react/Component>, to help you understand the code.

The kind of things you might want to consider and comment on include:

- Is there room to improve error handling
- How might readability be improved
- Are there any obvious errors that might cause problems
- Is there anything you especially like, that is worthy of praise

Make notes of your feedback, reel free to discuss in pairs or small groups.

If you wish, feel free to put the code in the component into a LLM chatbot, and see if the answers it gives make sense and are useful.

### Option 2: Read a test from challenge 2

Swap with someone else in the workshop, that completed challenge 2.

The kind of things you might want to consider and comment on include:

- Is there room to improve error handling
- How might readability be improved
- Are there any obvious errors that might cause problems
- Is there anything you especially like, that is worthy of praise

Be kind when giving feedback, focus on suggestions for improvement, and factually describe errors or possible issues. You want to avoid telling someone off, judge the code not the coder.

Note: There is no example solution for this challenge.
