# Challenges

## Challenge 1

A senior member of the team has reviewed the tests and has questioned their validity. Can you please look into it?

## Challenge 2

I've just looked at the latest code coverage report for the BFF and discovered that snacks doesn't have much of anything covered - can you please check? We need to increase our code coverage.

## Challenge 3

Janet said Playwright is the new hotness and installed it. Too bad she's a contractor and already gone by now! The team is unfamiliar with e2e testing for the frontend. Can you create an example test they can build on?

## Challenge 4

We're dearly missing faster, more granular feedback when working on the frontend. The team is thinking of adding unit tests, yet lack experience and struggle to get started. Can you provide a starting point for them?
